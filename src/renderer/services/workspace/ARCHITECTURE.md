# CentralizedWorkspaceService Modular Architecture

## Overview

The `CentralizedWorkspaceService.js` file (1,323 lines) has been refactored into smaller, focused modules:

### Module Breakdown

1. **BaseStateManager.js** (59 lines)
   - Base class for state management
   - Handles listeners and state updates

2. **WorkspaceManager.js** (134 lines)
   - Workspace CRUD operations
   - Workspace data file management
   - Workspace validation

3. **SourceManager.js** (232 lines)
   - HTTP, File, Environment source management
   - Source dependency evaluation
   - Source activation logic

4. **RulesManager.js** (122 lines)
   - Header rules management
   - Proxy rules management
   - Rule synchronization with proxy

5. **AutoSaveManager.js** (106 lines)
   - Auto-save scheduling
   - Dirty state tracking
   - Periodic save intervals

6. **SyncManager.js** (115 lines)
   - Git workspace synchronization
   - Initial sync detection
   - Sync event handling

7. **BroadcastManager.js** (60 lines)
   - WebSocket state broadcasting
   - Proxy state updates

8. **CentralizedWorkspaceService.refactored.js** (~600 lines)
   - Main service coordinating all modules
   - Public API maintained

## Implementation Status

âœ… **Completed** - The modular architecture is now in place. Since this is a new project with no existing users, we were able to directly replace the monolithic service with the modular version.

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Each module has a single responsibility
2. **Testability**: Modules can be unit tested independently
3. **Performance**: Reduced file size for faster parsing
4. **Reusability**: Modules can be used in other services
5. **Clarity**: Easier to understand and modify specific functionality

## Architecture Design

The modular design follows the Single Responsibility Principle, with each module handling a specific aspect of workspace management. This makes the codebase easier to understand, test, and maintain.

## Additional Improvements Made

1. **Fixed state mutations**: All state updates now use `setState()`
2. **Added proper cleanup**: Memory leaks prevented
3. **Improved error handling**: Better rollback on failures
4. **Added validation**: Workspace ID uniqueness checks
5. **Centralized broadcasting**: Single point for WebSocket/proxy updates

## Future Improvements

1. Replace `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` with a proper deep clone library
2. Add unit tests for each module
3. Consider using TypeScript for better type safety
4. Add event emitter pattern instead of direct window events
5. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
