## Branching Strategy

We use a feature-based branching strategy. All branches should be created from the `main` branch.

### Branch Naming Conventions

- **Feature branches**: `feature/short-description` or `feature/issue-number-description`
  - Example: `feature/totp-authentication` or `feature/42-json-filtering`

- **Bug fix branches**: `fix/short-description` or `fix/issue-number-description`
  - Example: `fix/websocket-connection` or `fix/57-react-rendering`

- **Documentation branches**: `docs/short-description`
  - Example: `docs/api-documentation`

- **Performance improvement branches**: `perf/short-description`
  - Example: `perf/http-request-caching`

- **Refactoring branches**: `refactor/short-description`
  - Example: `refactor/source-context`

- **UI branches**: `ui/short-description`
  - Example: `ui/dark-mode-support`

- **Testing branches**: `test/short-description`
  - Example: `test/source-service`

- **Platform-specific branches**: `platform/os-name-description`
  - Example: `platform/macos-dock-icon` or `platform/linux-support`

### Branch Lifecycle

1. Create a branch for your work
2. Make your changes and push them
3. Open a pull request
4. After approval and merging, delete the branch

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow a simplified version of the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard.

### Format

```
<type>: <short summary>
<BLANK LINE>
<optional body>
<BLANK LINE>
<optional footer>
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Changes that don't affect code functionality (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **chore**: Changes to build process, dependencies, etc.
- **ui**: User interface changes
- **platform**: Platform-specific changes or compatibility fixes

### Examples

```
feat: add TOTP authentication for HTTP sources

This change adds support for time-based one-time passwords in HTTP requests.
Users can enter a TOTP secret and use _TOTP_CODE placeholder in requests.

Closes #42
```

```
ui: integrate Ant Design component library

Refactors the entire UI from vanilla HTML/CSS/JS to React with Ant Design.
- Adds React component structure
- Creates context providers for state management
- Implements custom hooks for business logic
- Updates build process with webpack for React

Closes #57
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a pull request** from your feature branch to the `main` branch of the original repository
2. **Fill out the PR template** with all relevant information
3. **Link any related issues** using GitHub's keywords (Fixes #123, Closes #456, etc.)
4. **Wait for the review process** - maintainers will review your code
5. **Make any requested changes** based on the review feedback
6. **Once approved**, a maintainer will merge your PR

### PR Size Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single issue or feature when possible
- Large changes should be broken into smaller, logically separate PRs
- If a PR becomes too large, consider splitting it

## Cross-Platform Testing

All contributions should be tested across supported platforms:

### Required Testing

1. **Testing on your platform**:
   - Test all affected functionality thoroughly
   - Verify UI rendering and interactions
   - Check console for errors

### Recommended Testing (if possible)

2. **Cross-platform testing**:
   - Test on macOS, Windows, and Linux if possible
   - Verify platform-specific features (dock icon, tray icon, etc.)
   - Test with different screen resolutions and DPI settings

### Testing Focus Areas

- **UI Rendering**: Verify components render correctly across platforms
- **File Watching**: Verify file monitoring works correctly
- **Settings**: Confirm settings persist between sessions
- **Performance**: Check for any platform-specific performance issues

## Documentation

When adding features or making significant changes, please update the relevant documentation:

1. **Code comments**:
   - Use JSDoc format for function and class documentation
   - Document React components with prop descriptions
   - Explain complex logic or platform-specific code

2. **README.md**:
   - Update for new features or changed behaviors
   - Add examples for new functionality

3. **DEVELOPER.md**:
   - Update technical details for developers
   - Document architecture changes

## Issue Tracking

We use GitHub Issues to track bugs, enhancements, and feature requests.

### Creating Issues

- **Bug reports**: Include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, actual behavior, platform details, and app version
- **Feature requests**: Describe the feature, its benefits, and potential implementation approaches
- **Enhancement requests**: Explain what existing functionality should be improved and why

### Issue Labels

- `bug`: A problem with the application
- `feature`: A new feature request
- `enhancement`: Improvement to existing functionality
- `documentation`: Documentation improvements
- `good first issue`: Good for newcomers
- `help wanted`: Extra attention is needed
- `wontfix`: This will not be worked on
- `platform-macos`: macOS-specific issues
- `platform-windows`: Windows-specific issues
- `platform-linux`: Linux-specific issues
- `ui`: User interface issues
- `backend`: Backend service issues

## Release Process

Our release process follows these steps:

1. **Version bump** in package.json
2. **Create a release branch**: `release/vX.Y.Z`
3. **Final testing** on the release branch for all supported platforms
4. **Generate production builds** for all platforms:
   ```bash
   npm run dist:all
   ```
5. **Create a GitHub release** with the version tag and release notes
6. **Publish platform-specific installers** to GitHub releases

### Version Numbering

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for new features in a backward-compatible manner
- **PATCH** version for backward-compatible bug fixes

## React and Ant Design Guidelines

When working with React components and Ant Design:

- **Component Structure**: Each component should have a single responsibility
- **State Management**: Use context providers for global state, component state for local state
- **Custom Hooks**: Extract complex logic into custom hooks
- **Ant Design Usage**: Follow Ant Design patterns and conventions
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure components work across different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Ensure components are accessible (keyboard navigation, screen readers, etc.)
- **Performance**: Use React performance best practices (useMemo, useCallback, etc.)
