2. The response will be displayed in the "Response Preview" section
3. You can view the body, headers, and raw response in separate tabs

### ✏️ Editing HTTP Sources

After creating an HTTP source, you can edit its configuration at any time:

1. In the sources table, find the HTTP source you want to edit
2. Click the "Edit" button in the Actions column
3. Modify any of the source properties:
   - URL and HTTP method

The edit interface provides full access to all HTTP source features and preserves your configuration even when toggling options on and off. Field values remain available until you cancel the edit operation.

### 🔍 Using JSON Filtering

JSON filtering allows you to extract specific values from JSON responses:

1. Enable the "JSON Filter" toggle in the Options tab
2. Enter a JSON path using dot notation:
   - Start with `root` to reference the root object
   - Use dots to access nested properties (e.g., `root.data.user.name`)
   - Use brackets with indices for arrays (e.g., `root.items[0].id`)
3. Click "Test Request" to preview the filtered result
4. After adding the source, the JSON filter will be applied to all responses

#### 📌 JSON Path Examples:
- `root.data.token` - Extracts the token property from the data object
- `root.results[0].id` - Extracts the id from the first item in the results array
- `root.user.addresses[2].street` - Extracts the street from the third address in the user's addresses

### 🔐 Using TOTP Authentication

For APIs requiring time-based one-time passwords:

1. Enable the "TOTP Authentication" toggle in the Options tab
2. Enter your TOTP secret key (base32 encoded)
3. Click "Test" to verify the TOTP code generation
4. Use `_TOTP_CODE` placeholder in any part of your request:
   - In URL: `https://api.example.com/verify?code=_TOTP_CODE`
   - In headers: `Authorization: Bearer _TOTP_CODE`
   - In body: `{"verification_code": "_TOTP_CODE"}`

The application will automatically generate and insert the current TOTP code whenever the request is made.

### ⏰ Setting Up Auto-Refresh

To automatically update HTTP sources at regular intervals:

1. Enable the "Auto-Refresh" toggle in the Options tab
2. Choose a refresh method:
   - **Preset**: Select from predefined intervals (1 min to 24 hours)
   - **Custom**: Enter a specific interval in minutes
3. Click "Add Source" to create the source with auto-refresh enabled

The source will be refreshed automatically according to the specified interval. You can view the next refresh time in the source list.

### 📊 Viewing Source Content

To view the content of any source:

1. In the sources table, click the "View" button for the source
2. For HTTP sources, you can see:
   - Filtered Response (if JSON filtering is enabled)
   - Original Response
   - HTTP Headers
3. For file and environment variable sources, you'll see the raw content

### 💾 Importing and Exporting Sources

Easily save and share your source configurations:

#### 📤 Exporting Sources
1. Click the menu button in the top-right corner
2. Select "Export Sources"
3. Choose a location to save the JSON file
4. All source configurations will be saved to the file

#### 📥 Importing Sources

2. Select "Import Sources"
3. Select a previously exported JSON file
4. The sources will be loaded and added to your existing sources

The application will detect duplicate sources during import and only add new ones.

### 🔽 Minimizing to Tray

## 🔄 Connecting to the Browser Extension

1. Install the Open Headers browser extension:
   - 🌐 **[Google Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ablaikadpbfblkmhpmbbnbbfjoibeejb?utm_source=item-share-cb)**
   - 🔷 **[Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/open-headers/gnbibobkkddlflknjkgcmokdlpddegpo)**
   - 🦊 **[Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-headers/)**
   - **🐙 Build it yourself from [Github](https://github.com/OpenHeaders/open-headers-browser-extension)**
2. Launch the Dynamic Sources application
3. The extension will automatically connect to the application:
   - Chrome/Edge use standard WebSocket (WS) on port 59210
   - Firefox uses secure WebSocket (WSS) on port 59211
4. In the extension popup, your dynamic sources will appear as options when creating headers

The application automatically generates and manages self-signed certificates for the secure WebSocket connection used by Firefox.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### 🔄 Update Issues

If automatic updates aren't working:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Ensure you have write permissions to the application directory
3. Try manually downloading the latest version
4. Check the log file at:
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Logs/OpenHeaders/main.log`
   - **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\OpenHeaders\logs\main.log`
   - **Linux**: `~/.config/OpenHeaders/logs/main.log`

### 🔌 Extension Connection Problems

If the browser extension can't connect:

1. Ensure the Open Headers app is running
2. Check if any firewall is blocking localhost connections on ports 59210/59211
3. For Firefox, you may need to accept the self-signed certificate by visiting:
   - https://localhost:59211/verify-cert

### 📁 File Watching Not Working

If file source updates aren't detected:

1. Ensure you have read permissions for the file
2. Try using an absolute file path instead of a relative path
3. Some network drives may not support file watching - copy to a local drive instead

### 🐞 Common Errors

- **"Failed to connect to WebSocket server"**: Ensure the app is running and no other application is using ports 59210/59211
- **"Failed to update source"**: Check your internet connection or API endpoint
- **"Failed to generate TOTP code"**: Verify your TOTP secret is correct and properly formatted
- **"JSON filter path not found"**: Check that your JSON path matches the actual response structure
